# Brickout: A Retro Game for the Pibit Console

Welcome to **Brickout**, a classic block-breaking game built for the **Pibit**, a fictional handheld console concept designed to bring retro gaming charm to the modern world! Powered by a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**, an **800x480 screen**, and **X-input controls** in a format similar to a Gameboy Advance, Pibit is your gateway to learning and building nostalgic games like *Brickout* using **C**, **OpenGL**, and **SDL**.

This repository contains the full tutorial for programming **Brickout**, making it the perfect first step into the world of graphics programming for the Raspberry Pi.

## 🎮 What is Pibit?

Pibit is a fictional handheld console project designed to inspire makers, coders, and hobbyists to dive into game development on the Raspberry Pi platform. It's a fun, educational journey that helps you learn how to program graphics in **C**, using powerful libraries like OpenGL and SDL, all while emulating a charming retro aesthetic.

## 🔨 What You'll Learn

Throughout this tutorial, you'll go through the following steps:

1. **Introduction** – Get started with the Pibit setup and learn the basics of the project.
2. **Open a Window** – Set up your development environment and create a simple window.
3. **Draw a Triangle** – Your first step into OpenGL rendering.
4. **Separate Shaders** – Organize your shaders for flexible rendering.
5. **Shader Program** – Compile and link shaders into a reusable program.
6. **Orthogonal Coordinates** – Switch to 2D orthographic projection for classic 2D games.
7. **Draw a Ball** – Create a simple shape to represent the ball in Brickout.
8. **Set Ball Position** – Position the ball dynamically on the screen.
9. **Move a Ball** – Implement basic movement and animation for the ball.
10. **Bounce a Ball** – Add collision detection and make the ball bounce off walls.
11. **Define Ball Struct** – Organize your ball's properties using C structures.
12. **Draw a Paddle** – Render the paddle and prepare it for gameplay.
13. **Paddle Uniform Color** – Add color and control properties to the paddle.
14. **Keydown Callbacks** – Implement keyboard controls to move the paddle.
15. **Paddle Hit Detection** – Handle ball-paddle collisions.
16. **Draw a Row of Bricks** – Start building the brick wall.
17. **Draw Grid of Bricks** – Expand your brick wall into a full grid.
18. **Break Some Bricks** – Implement the satisfying breaking mechanics when bricks are hit.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a fully functional *Brickout* game running on your Pibit console!

## 🚀 Getting Started

To follow along with the tutorial, you'll need:

- A **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**
- An **800x480 screen** (or any compatible display)
- **X-input controls** (e.g., a compatible gamepad or keyboard for testing)
- A working knowledge of **C programming**

Clone this repository to get started:
